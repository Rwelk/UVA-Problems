This is a repository for all of the problems I have solved in my college's Programming Team Competitions.
In the wiki, you will see all of the code I have typed, with comments explaining my thought processes.
I'm kind of new to GitHub, so if this is a dumb and ugly way of doing things, I'm sorry in advance.
