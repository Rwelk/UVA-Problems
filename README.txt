This is a repository for some of the the problems from UVA I have solved.
These were all done in conjunction with my college programming team.
In the wiki, you will see all of the code I have typed, with comments explaining my thought processes.
I'm kind of new to GitHub, so if this is a dumb and ugly way of doing things, I'm sorry in advance.
